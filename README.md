#Brett's Music Shop

This program was created for a project in a Visual Basic course at University Maryland Baltimore County (IS 246)

###Grade: 100%

The mainline algorithm for this program is to stage a real-life music shop website in which customers are able to browse
through various instruments. The instruments are partitioned into four different categories: woodwind, strings, brazz, and percussion.
Customers are granted the ability to sign up and be added to a Microsoft Access Database. Various customer data is gathered such as 
information regarding the customer and transactional data in order to extrapolate favorite items based on frequent purchasing trends.

There is a second portion of this program in which database administrators have access to. The database administrators are able to 
manage the Microsoft Access Database through this software rather seemlessly. Thus, the database administrators are able to search 
for customers in order to bring up transaction history, or delete the customer from the database.

Another addition to this program to note is that it features a real-time inventory system such that as soon as a customer confirms their
purchases, the inventory table of the database updates.
